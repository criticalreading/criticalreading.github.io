### About Elliott

Elliott Kuecker considers himself fortunate to be a member in one of the longest-running critical theory reading groups born in 1994 at the University of Florida. The Marxist
Reading Group is still going and has hosted a successful annual conference for years, and has been integral to the ongoing influence of Marxism at the University of Florida English department. Elliott has many years of experience running successful reading groups, including Critical Digital Humanities Working Group for the past two years here at UGA.
