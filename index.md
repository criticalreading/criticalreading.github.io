This site presents <a href="http://viraltexts.northeastern.edu" target="_blank">data</a>, <a href="http://networks.viraltexts.org/1836to1899/index.html" target="_blank">visualizations</a>, <a href="http://loveletter.viraltexts.org/neatline/fullscreen/exhibit" target="_blank">interactive exhibits</a>, and both [computational and literary publications](/publications/) drawn from the Viral Texts project, which seeks to develop theoretical models that will help scholars better understand what qualities—both textual and thematic—helped particular news stories, short fiction, and poetry “go viral” in nineteenth-century newspapers and magazines. During this period, texts published in newspapers and magazines were not typically protected as intellectual property, and so literary texts as well as other non-fiction prose texts circulated promiscuously among newspapers as editors freely reprinted materials borrowed from other venues. In the <em>Viral Texts</em> project, we're asking: What texts were reprinted and why? How did ideas—literary, political, scientific, economic, religious—circulate in the public sphere and achieve critical force among audiences? By employing and developing computational linguistics tools to analyze the large textual databases of nineteenth-century newspapers newly available to scholars, this project will generate new knowledge of the nineteenth-century print public sphere.
